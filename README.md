### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Benny**](https://benny-chi-ten.vercel.app/), a Software Engineer and an athelete based in Vizag!

I currently work as a Software Engineer Intern at [**@WebbHeads**](https://www.webbheads.com/), where I architect scalable full-stack solutions. I help build comprehensive web platforms and high-performance backend architectures.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products. I have engineered AR navigation systems, encrypted mobile apps, and have contributed to building comprehensive web platforms and full-stack applications.

Outside of work, I am a competitive **Badminton player** having performed at the National level. I also served as President of my university's sports club, where I directed large-scale tournaments and student engagement initiatives.
