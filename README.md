### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm Benny, a Full Stack Developer and an athelete based in Vizag!

I am a Full-Stack Developer specializing in architecting scalable solutions, ranging from high-performance backend architectures to comprehensive web/app platforms.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products. My technical portfolio includes engineering AR navigation systems , building encrypted mobile applications, and developing complex full-stack CRM systems using Next.js and PostgreSQL.

Outside of code, I am a competitive Badminton player having performed at the National level. I also served as President of my university's sports club, where I directed a student organization of 80+ members and organized large-scale tournaments.
